## Initial Thoughts

600px+

- Frame the painting (flex, centered div) with padding for the canvas and an elegant border (styles TBD) **DONE**
- Use a GRID layout, spanning over the dimensions of the painting **DONE**
- Get the dimensions of each rectangle, then recreate with a grid layout **DONE**
- 28 rectangles in total **DONE**
- Set a default black border on each rectangle (rectangle class) **DONE**
- Refactor for finishing touches

600px-

- Turn flex direction into a column, so that divs of previous grid rectangles line up vertically. **DONE**
- Each div is a container for each gridded color div (rectangle), based on the additional class name from the large image.
- Get number of rectangles for each color, then make that number of rectangles the correlating background color. **DONE**
  - Ex: 4 red rectangles; grab 4 child rectangles and make them red **DONE**
